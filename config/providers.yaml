# Configuration for data providers
#
# This file defines the available data providers and the strategy for using them.
# The system uses a primary/fallback mechanism. It will always try the 'primary'
# provider first. If it fails (health check fails, returns no data, or returns
# data that doesn't match the contract), it will try the 'fallback' providers
# in the order they are listed.

# The 'strategy' key defines which providers to use and in what order.
strategy:
  primary: boturfers # The main provider to use in production.
  fallback:
    - mock        # A fallback provider, in this case, the mock one for demonstration.

# The 'providers' key lists all known provider implementations.
# Each key here must correspond to a provider's `get_name()` output.
providers:
  mock:
    # Class path to the provider's implementation.
    # The registry will use this to dynamically import and instantiate the provider.
    class: hippique_orchestrator.providers.mock_provider.MockProvider
    # Provider-specific settings can be added here if needed.
    # For the mock provider, no settings are required.
    config: {}

  boturfers:
    # Placeholder for the real Boturfers provider.
    # We will create this class in a later step.
    class: hippique_orchestrator.providers.boturfers_provider.BoturfersProvider
    config:
      # Example of provider-specific configuration
